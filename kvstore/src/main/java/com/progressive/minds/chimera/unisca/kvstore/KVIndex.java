 * Tags a field to be indexed when storing an object.

 * Types are required to have a natural index that uniquely identifies instances in the store.
 * The default value of the annotation identifies the natural index for the type.

 *
 * <p>
 * Indexes allow for more efficient sorting of data read from the store. By annotating a field or
 * "getter" method with this annotation, an index will be created that will provide sorting based on
 * the string value of that field.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Note that creating indices means more space will be needed, and maintenance operations like
 * updating or deleting a value will become more expensive.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Indices are restricted to String, integral types (byte, short, int, long, boolean), and arrays
 * of those values.
